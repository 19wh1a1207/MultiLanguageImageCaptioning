# Multi Language Image Captioning
## Abstract 
Image Caption Generator deals with generating captions for a given image. The semantic meaning in the image is captured and converted into a natural language. The captioning mechanism involves a tedious task that collaborates both image processing and computer vision. The mechanism must detect and establish relationships between objects, people, and animals. The aim of our project is to detect, recognize and generate worthwhile captions for a given image using deep learning. We propose an encoder-decoder framework for our model. For encoding we use CNN and for decoding we use LSTM model of RNN. To build our image caption generator model, we will be merging CNN and RNN-LSTM architectures. Our model also generates text in 133 different languages.
